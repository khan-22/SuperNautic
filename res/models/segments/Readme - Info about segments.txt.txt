Level segments have the following naming convention:

The most basic segment, a straight tube is called s01aa.
s - Segment
01 - Number (01 is always a straight piece)
aa - Indicates the start and end connections of the tube, a being the basic type. A tube that ends in "ab" starts as an a connection and ends with a b type connection
meaning it must be connected to a tube that is instead sXXba. (going from type b to a for example) 

The collision mesh is always called CM.

Waypoints are numbered and are called WPX, where X indicates the number of the waypoint (0, 1, 2, 3 etc..)

Pointlights are called PLX, where X indicates the number.

Bounding boxes are named BBX, where X indicates the number of the bounding box since we may have several.

The end point camera which we use to define a direction at the end of each tube is always called WPEnd.
